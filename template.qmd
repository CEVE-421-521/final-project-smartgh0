# Introduction
The project seek to investigate the impact of uncertainties from Sea level rise, storm surge, and discount rates on insurance premiums. The annual expected damage is a major factor in estimating insurance premiums for buildings in flood prone locations, and the work seek to explore how the uncertainties in these variables that make up the annual expected damage affects the estimates. 

The project seek also to explore the savings in insurance premiums when elevating a house by application of elevating certificate thorugh which FEMA  gives qualifying discounts to home owners who elevates their homes to certian hieghts. 

## Problem Statement
Expected damage or loss is an important factor in calculating insurance premiums. There are uncertainties associated with sea level rise, discount rates, storm surge and other variables that make up the expected damage or loss. 

Using probabilitic approach to explore how these uncertainties affects the expected annual damage or losses with help insurance companies in computing their insurance premiums. Exploring also the savings in insurance premium as a result of elevating a house for house owners will also help home owners in their decision on elevating their homes. 

Clearly define the problem statement that your chosen feature aims to address.
Explain the significance of this problem in the context of climate risk management.

## Selected Feature

1. Policy search; to explore how various input variables impact final estimated insurance premium.
2. Optimization; to find Optimal elevation level that will maximize savings in insurance premium
3. Sequencial decision making to decide when to elevate after setting a threshold for savings  

Describe the feature you have selected to add to the existing decision-support tool.
Discuss how this feature relates to the problem statement and its potential to improve climate risk assessment.

# Literature Review

Provide a brief overview of the theoretical background related to your chosen feature.
Cite at least two relevant journal articles to support your approach (see [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) for help with citations).
Explain how these articles contribute to the justification of your selected feature.

# Methodology

## Implementation

You should make your modifications in either the `HouseElevation` or `ParkingGarage` module.
Detail the steps taken to implement the selected feature and integrate it into the decision-support tool.
Include code snippets and explanations where necessary to clarify the implementation process.

## Validation

As we have seen in labs, mistakes are inevitable and can lead to misleading results.
To minimize the risk of errors making their way into final results, it is essential to validate the implemented feature.
Describe the validation techniques used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implemented feature.
Discuss any challenges faced during the validation process and how they were addressed.

# Results

Present the results obtained from the enhanced decision-support tool.
Use tables, figures, and visualizations to clearly communicate the outcomes.
Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the implemented feature addresses the problem statement.
Use the `#| output: false` and/or `#| echo: false` tags to hide code output and code cells in the final report except where showing the output (e.g.g, a plot) or the code (e.g., how you are sampling SOWs) adds value to the discussion.
You may have multiple subsections of results, which you can create using `##`.

# Conclusions

## Discussion

Analyze the implications of your results for climate risk management.
Consider the context of the class themes and discuss how your findings contribute to the understanding of climate risk assessment.
Identify any limitations of your approach and suggest potential improvements for future work.

## Conclusions

Summarize the key findings of your project and reiterate the significance of your implemented feature in addressing the problem statement.
Discuss the broader implications of your work for climate risk management and the potential for further research in this area.
