# Introduction
The project seek to investigate the impact of uncertainties from Sea level rise, storm surge, discount rates, and insurance premiums on our annual expected damages in the house elevation problem.

Premium = E[losses] + V.stdev [loses]
 
## Problem Statement 
Adding insurance premium in the house elevation problem to explore it's impact on expected annual damages. 

Using probabilitic approach to explore how these uncertainties affects the expected annual damage
Considering insrance premium in our model help us explore the trade-offs between upfront cost or borrowing and insurance costs needs good premiums


Clearly define the problem statement that your chosen feature aims to address.
Explain the significance of this problem in the context of climate risk management.

## Selected Feature

1. Policy search; to explore how various input variables impact expected losses
2. Optimization; to find Optimal elevation level 
3. Sequencial decision making to decide when to elevate after setting a threshold for insurance premium.

Describe the feature you have selected to add to the existing decision-support tool.
Discuss how this feature relates to the problem statement and its potential to improve climate risk assessment.

# Literature Review

Provide a brief overview of the theoretical background related to your chosen feature.
Cite at least two relevant journal articles to support your approach (see [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) for help with citations).
Explain how these articles contribute to the justification of your selected feature.

# Methodology

## Implementation

You should make your modifications in either the `HouseElevation` or `ParkingGarage` module.
Detail the steps taken to implement the selected feature and integrate it into the decision-support tool.
Include code snippets and explanations where necessary to clarify the implementation process.

## Validation

As we have seen in labs, mistakes are inevitable and can lead to misleading results.
To minimize the risk of errors making their way into final results, it is essential to validate the implemented feature.
Describe the validation techniques used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implemented feature.
Discuss any challenges faced during the validation process and how they were addressed.

# Results

Present the results obtained from the enhanced decision-support tool.
Use tables, figures, and visualizations to clearly communicate the outcomes.
Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the implemented feature addresses the problem statement.
Use the `#| output: false` and/or `#| echo: false` tags to hide code output and code cells in the final report except where showing the output (e.g.g, a plot) or the code (e.g., how you are sampling SOWs) adds value to the discussion.
You may have multiple subsections of results, which you can create using `##`.

# Conclusions

## Discussion

Analyze the implications of your results for climate risk management.
Consider the context of the class themes and discuss how your findings contribute to the understanding of climate risk assessment.
Identify any limitations of your approach and suggest potential improvements for future work.

## Conclusions

Summarize the key findings of your project and reiterate the significance of your implemented feature in addressing the problem statement.
Discuss the broader implications of your work for climate risk management and the potential for further research in this area.
